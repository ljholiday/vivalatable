# VivalaTable Migration Project

## What We're Building
**Complete LAMP migration of PartyMinder WordPress plugin to standalone application**

VivalaTable is a professional event management and community platform that replicates all PartyMinder functionality without WordPress dependencies:

- **Event Management System** - Create, manage, and RSVP to events with guest limits and privacy controls
- **Community Platform** - Create communities with membership management and community-specific events
- **Guest System** - 32-character token-based guest invitations allowing RSVP without registration
- **Circles of Trust Privacy** - Anti-algorithm social filtering with granular privacy controls
- **User Management** - Registration, authentication, profiles, and statistics tracking
- **Conversation System** - Community discussions with privacy-based filtering
- **AI Assistant Integration** - AI-powered event planning and management features
- **AT Protocol/Bluesky Integration** - Social media connectivity

## Project Status: ACTIVE MIGRATION
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-27
**Current Phase:** Discovery and gap analysis

## Quick Reference Commands

### Database Comparison
```bash
# Compare table structures
mysql -u root -proot partyminder_db -e "SHOW TABLES LIKE 'wp_pm_%';"
mysql -u root -proot vivalatable -e "SHOW TABLES LIKE 'vt_%';"

# Check for missing tables
mysql -u root -proot partyminder_db -e "SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name LIKE 'wp_pm_%';" | sed 's/wp_pm_/vt_/' > expected_tables.txt
mysql -u root -proot vivalatable -e "SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name LIKE 'vt_%';" > actual_tables.txt
diff expected_tables.txt actual_tables.txt
```

### Route Coverage Analysis
```bash
# Find all route definitions
grep -r "route\|path\|url" config/ includes/ | grep -E "(=>|->)"

# Check for missing PartyMinder shortcodes
grep -r "\[partyminder_" ~/Documents/partyminder/ | cut -d: -f2 | sort -u

# Compare to VivalaTable routes
grep -r "case.*:" includes/ | grep -E "(events|communities|dashboard|profile)"
```

### Class Method Comparison
```bash
# List all PartyMinder class methods
find ~/Documents/partyminder/includes -name "class-*.php" -exec grep -H "public function\|private function\|protected function" {} \;

# List VivalaTable class methods
find includes/ -name "class-*.php" -exec grep -H "public function\|private function\|protected function" {} \;

# Compare specific classes
diff <(grep "function " ~/Documents/partyminder/includes/class-event-manager.php) <(grep "function " includes/class-event-manager.php)
```

### AJAX Endpoint Discovery
```bash
# Find PartyMinder AJAX handlers
grep -r "wp_ajax\|ajax_" ~/Documents/partyminder/

# Find VivalaTable AJAX handlers
grep -r "ajax\|xhr" includes/ templates/

# Check for missing endpoints
grep -r "action.*:" ~/Local\ Sites/socialpartyminderlocal/app/public/wp-content/plugins/partyminder/assets/js/ | cut -d: -f2 | sort -u
```

### Template/Page Completeness
```bash
# List PartyMinder template files
find ~/Documents/partyminder/ -name "*content*.php" -o -name "*template*.php"

# Compare to VivalaTable templates
ls templates/ | sort
```

### CSS Class Coverage
```bash
# Extract all pm- classes from PartyMinder
grep -ro "pm-[a-zA-Z0-9_-]*" ~/Local\ Sites/socialpartyminderlocal/app/public/wp-content/plugins/partyminder/ | sort -u > pm_classes.txt

# Check if they exist as vt- classes in VivalaTable
sed 's/pm-/vt-/' pm_classes.txt | while read class; do
    if ! grep -q "$class" assets/css/vivalatable.css; then
        echo "Missing: $class"
    fi
done
```

### Critical Feature Testing
```bash
# Guest system - 32-character tokens
mysql -u root -proot vivalatable -e "SELECT LENGTH(token) FROM vt_guests LIMIT 5;"

# Circles of Trust privacy system
mysql -u root -proot vivalatable -e "SELECT DISTINCT privacy FROM vt_events;"
mysql -u root -proot vivalatable -e "SELECT DISTINCT privacy FROM vt_communities;"

# Community membership system
mysql -u root -proot vivalatable -e "DESCRIBE vt_community_members;"
```

### Error Log Analysis
```bash
# Check for undefined methods/properties
tail -f /var/log/apache2/error.log | grep -E "(undefined|fatal|notice)"

# Look for missing files
grep -r "include\|require" includes/ | while read line; do
    file=$(echo "$line" | sed -n "s/.*['\"]([^'\"]*)['\"].*/\1/p")
    [ ! -f "$file" ] && echo "Missing: $file"
done
```

### Critical Issues Found - RSVP Table Redundancy
**PROBLEM:** Three duplicate RSVP tables exist with overlapping functionality:

1. **vt_guests** (2 records) - PartyMinder equivalent, has 32-char tokens
   - Columns: rsvp_token, temporary_guest_id, converted_user_id, event_id, name, email, status, etc.
   - **PRIMARY TABLE** - Used by existing code

2. **vt_rsvps** (0 records) - Duplicate functionality
   - Similar columns but different structure
   - **UNUSED** - No code references found

3. **vt_event_rsvps** (0 records) - Another duplicate
   - Similar columns, referenced in class-auth.php:200
   - **PARTIALLY USED** - Only guest-to-user conversion

**SOLUTION NEEDED:** Consolidate to vt_guests table only, update code references

### Events Table Analysis
**STATUS:** VivalaTable events table has ALL PartyMinder columns PLUS many additional features:
- [PASS] Core columns match (id, title, slug, description, etc.)
- [ENHANCED] Added features: recurring events, privacy controls, community linking
- [REVIEW] Duplicate status columns: `event_status` vs `status`, `privacy` vs `visibility`

## Guest Token System Test Results

**VALIDATION COMPLETE - PASSING ALL REQUIREMENTS**

### Token Generation Testing:
- [PASS] VT_Security::generateToken(32) generates exactly 32-character tokens
- [PASS] VT_Auth::generateGuestToken() generates exactly 32-character tokens
- [PASS] All tokens use cryptographically secure random_bytes() function
- [PASS] Tokens are properly hex-encoded (bin2hex format)

### Token Storage Testing:
- [PASS] Existing guest records have 32-character rsvp_token fields
- [PASS] Existing guest records have 32-character temporary_guest_id fields
- [PASS] Database schema supports varchar(32) for token fields

### Token Validation Testing:
- [PASS] VT_Guest_Manager::getGuestByToken() correctly validates existing tokens
- [PASS] VT_Guest_Manager::processAnonymousRsvp() rejects tokens < 32 characters
- [PASS] VT_Guest_Manager::processAnonymousRsvp() rejects tokens > 32 characters
- [PASS] VT_Error class properly handles and reports validation failures
- [PASS] Non-existent 32-character tokens are properly rejected

### Integration Testing:
- [PASS] Guest invitation system generates proper 32-character tokens
- [PASS] Guest-to-user conversion system works with converted_user_id field
- [PASS] Token-based RSVP URLs are properly constructed

**CONCLUSION: Guest token system fully compliant with PartyMinder specifications**

## Class Method Coverage Analysis Results

### Core Class Mapping Status:
- [PASS] event-manager → event-manager (all methods ported, camelCase naming)
- [PASS] guest-manager → guest-manager (all core methods ported, enhanced functionality)
- [PASS] community-manager → community-manager (core methods ported, some missing)
- [PASS] conversation-manager → conversation-manager (exists)
- [PASS] feature-flags → feature-flags (exists)
- [PASS] profile-manager → profile-manager (exists)
- [PASS] member-identity-manager → member-identity-manager (exists)
- [MISSING] ai-assistant → **NO EQUIVALENT CLASS** (critical missing functionality)
- [MISSING] at-protocol-manager → **NO EQUIVALENT CLASS** (Bluesky integration missing)

### Event Manager - FULLY COVERED
All 14 PartyMinder methods have VivalaTable equivalents (converted to camelCase):
- accept_event_invitation → acceptEventInvitation
- cancel_event_invitation → cancelEventInvitation
- create_event → createEvent
- Plus 9 additional enhanced methods for privacy and community features

### Guest Manager - MOSTLY COVERED
6/7 PartyMinder methods have equivalents, 1 missing:
- [MISSING] get_rsvp_success_message (confirmation messaging)
- All other core RSVP functionality present and working

### Community Manager - PARTIALLY COVERED
Missing 9 critical methods:
- [MISSING] cancel_invitation
- [MISSING] ensure_member_has_did
- [MISSING] generate_community_did
- [MISSING] generate_unique_slug
- [MISSING] get_admin_count
- [MISSING] get_community_invitations
- [MISSING] get_community_stats
- [MISSING] get_public_communities
- [MISSING] remove_member
- [MISSING] update_member_role

### CRITICAL MISSING FUNCTIONALITY
1. **AI Assistant Class** - Complete absence of AI planning features
2. **AT Protocol Manager** - Complete absence of Bluesky integration
3. **Community Management Gaps** - 9 missing methods affecting community functionality

## Naming Convention Violation Fix

**PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:** Fatal error due to snake_case method calls in class-conversation-manager.php
**ROOT CAUSE:** Mixed naming conventions - methods defined as camelCase but called as snake_case

## Naming Convention Fixes Summary

### FIXED: class-conversation-manager.php (11 violations):
- [FIXED] `getconversation_replies()` → `getConversationReplies()`
- [FIXED] `generateconversation_slug()` → `generateConversationSlug()`
- [FIXED] `validateconversation_privacy()` → `validateConversationPrivacy()`
- [FIXED] `follow_conversation()` → `followConversation()`
- [FIXED] `mark_conversation_updated()` → `markConversationUpdated()`
- [FIXED] `getcommunity_privacy()` → `getCommunityPrivacy()`
- [FIXED] `getevent_privacy()` → `getEventPrivacy()`
- [FIXED] `validateprivacy_setting()` → `validatePrivacySetting()`

### FIXED: class-member-identity-manager.php (9 violations):
- [FIXED] `generatemember_did()` → `generateMemberDid()`
- [FIXED] `generatemember_handle()` → `generateMemberHandle()`
- [FIXED] `getdefault_pds()` → `getDefaultPds()`
- [FIXED] `getmember_identity()` → `getMemberIdentity()` (5 instances)
- [FIXED] `getdefault_at_protocol_data()` → `getDefaultAtProtocolData()`

### FIXED: class-conversation-ajax-handler.php (3 violations):
- [FIXED] `handlefile_upload()` → `handleFileUpload()`
- [FIXED] `getcommunity_conversations()` → `getCommunityConversations()`

### FIXED: class-event-manager.php (2 violations):
- [FIXED] `validateprivacy_setting()` → `validatePrivacySetting()`

### REMAINING: class-community-ajax-handler.php (5 violations):
**These are calls to MISSING METHODS that need to be implemented:**
- [MISSING] `getadmin_count()` → needs `getAdminCount()` method
- [MISSING] `remove_member()` → needs `removeMember()` method
- [MISSING] `updatemember_role()` → needs `updateMemberRole()` method

### Fixed Method Calls in class-conversation-manager.php:
**TOTAL FIXED:** 25 naming convention violations across 4 class files
**REMAINING:** 5 violations in community-ajax-handler.php (require missing method implementation)

## Conversation Display Fix

**PROBLEM:** Conversations created in communities weren't visible on the main conversations page, even under the "Communities" filter tab.

**ROOT CAUSE:**
1. Template was showing "Loading conversations..." for logged-in users instead of actual content
2. Filter buttons were JavaScript-based instead of direct links
3. No actual conversation loading logic for filtered views

**FIXES APPLIED:**
1. **Added conversation loading logic** - Now properly loads conversations based on filter parameter
2. **Replaced placeholder content** - Removed "Loading..." message, now shows actual conversations
3. **Converted filter buttons to links** - Changed from JavaScript buttons to direct URL links (/conversations?filter=communities)
4. **Added active state highlighting** - Filter tabs now show active state based on current filter

**RESULT:** Community conversations now properly display when visiting `/conversations?filter=communities`

## Migration Methodology Reminders

### CRITICAL RULES
1. NO FEATURE FLAGS - All functionality must be enabled and working
2. Port each class methodically - copy method signatures exactly
3. Map WordPress fields to VT database schema properly - DO NOT DELETE
4. Understand what each removed piece of functionality was supposed to do
5. Keep a record of what needs proper replacement vs. removal
6. Replace WordPress database calls with PDO
7. Replace WordPress functions with custom equivalents
8. Test that migrated functionality actually works, not just that it doesn't throw errors

### NEVER
- Simply delete WordPress-specific fields without understanding their purpose
- Remove functionality just because it references WordPress
- Mark something "complete" when only syntax errors are fixed
- Assume unused classes don't need to work
- Use feature flags for anything

## Testing Workflows

### Guest Invitation Flow
```php
// 1. Create event
// 2. Send guest invitation
// 3. Guest RSVP without registration
// 4. Convert guest to user (optional)
```

### Community Workflow
```php
// 1. Create community
// 2. Invite members
// 3. Create community event
// 4. Member RSVP
```

### Privacy System Test
```php
// 1. Create private event
// 2. Verify non-members can't see
// 3. Test access levels
// 4. Test conversation filtering
```
