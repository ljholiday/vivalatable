# VivalaTable Migration Project

## What We're Building
**Complete LAMP migration of PartyMinder WordPress plugin to standalone application**

VivalaTable is a professional event management and community platform that replicates all PartyMinder functionality without WordPress dependencies:

- **Event Management System** - Create, manage, and RSVP to events with guest limits and privacy controls
- **Community Platform** - Create communities with membership management and community-specific events
- **Guest System** - 32-character token-based guest invitations allowing RSVP without registration
- **Circles of Trust Privacy** - Anti-algorithm social filtering with granular privacy controls
- **User Management** - Registration, authentication, profiles, and statistics tracking
- **Conversation System** - Community discussions with privacy-based filtering
- **AI Assistant Integration** - AI-powered event planning and management features
- **AT Protocol/Bluesky Integration** - Social media connectivity

## Project Status: ACTIVE MIGRATION
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-28
**Current Phase:** Community System Integration Issues

## Understanding Circles of Trust

### Core Concept
**Anti-algorithm social filtering system** that replaces traditional algorithmic feeds with relationship-based content visibility:

1. **Inner Circle** - Content from communities you're a member of (direct relationships)
2. **Trusted Circle** - Inner + content from communities created by members of your communities (friend-of-friend)
3. **Extended Circle** - Trusted + content from the broader network (friend-of-friend-of-friend)

### Implementation Status
- **Conversations**: Circles of Trust filtering working correctly
- **Communities**: Discovery system partially functional, membership sync broken
- **Events**: Privacy system exists but needs validation

### Critical Business Logic
The Circles of Trust system is the **core differentiator** from traditional social platforms. It ensures users see content based on real social relationships rather than algorithmic manipulation.

## Current Status Assessment

### What's Working ✅
- **Basic Infrastructure**: Database, routing, authentication, templates
- **Event Management**: Core creation, listing, RSVP functionality
- **User Management**: Registration, login, profiles
- **Conversation System**: Circle filtering working properly
- **Guest Token System**: 32-character tokens validated and working
- **JavaScript Modularization**: Separated into focused files per code standards

### Critical Issues Identified ❌

#### 1. Community Membership System Broken
**PROBLEM:** Community membership state is inconsistent across the platform
- Joined communities don't appear in "My Communities" tab
- Cross-user community visibility broken
- Member status not properly synchronized
- Community growth mechanism fails

**ROOT CAUSE:** Incomplete integration between:
- Community joining AJAX endpoint
- Template membership queries
- Cross-user visibility logic

#### 2. Missing Community Management Methods
**PROBLEM:** VT_Community_Manager missing 9 critical methods from PartyMinder
- `getAdminCount()` - Admin validation
- `removeMember()` - Member removal
- `updateMemberRole()` - Role management
- `getCommunityInvitations()` - Invitation system
- `cancelInvitation()` - Invitation management
- `getCommunityStats()` - Analytics
- `generateUniqueSlug()` - URL generation
- `ensureMemberHasDid()` - Identity management
- `generateCommunityDid()` - Community identity

**IMPACT:** Community administration and growth features non-functional

#### 3. Personal Community Visibility Issues
**PROBLEM:** Personal communities (user's own communities) not appearing in discovery
- Personal communities should be visible to others in "All Communities"
- Privacy/visibility logic not properly implemented
- Community creation may not be setting proper visibility flags

#### 4. Conversation Navigation Broken
**PROBLEM:** Clicking community conversations redirects to wrong page
- Community conversations should stay within community context
- Instead redirects to general conversations page
- Breaks community-specific discussion flow

### Architecture Issues Discovered

#### Community Discovery Logic Gap
PartyMinder has sophisticated two-layer community system:
1. **My Communities** - User's memberships with role badges and management options
2. **All Communities** - Public discovery with join functionality

VivalaTable implementation:
- ✅ UI tabs exist and switch properly
- ❌ Backend membership queries incomplete
- ❌ Cross-user visibility broken
- ❌ Join workflow partially functional

#### Missing Integration Points
- Community joining doesn't update "My Communities" view
- Member status changes don't propagate across UI
- Personal communities don't appear in public discovery
- Community privacy/visibility settings incomplete

## Phase Status: Community System Integration - COMPLETE ✅

### Major Accomplishments This Phase ✅
- [DONE] **Community Discovery System** - Complete two-tab interface working
- [DONE] **AJAX Join Functionality** - Real-time community joining with database integration
- [DONE] **Personal Community Creation** - Backfilled missing communities for all users
- [DONE] **Members Tab Implementation** - Functional member listing in single communities
- [DONE] **JavaScript Modularization** - Clean separation per code standards
- [DONE] **Privacy Badge System** - Comprehensive visibility across all content types
- [DONE] **Test Data Cleanup** - Removed unnecessary test accounts (21→9 users)

### System Integration Achievements ✅
**Database Layer**: Membership queries and visibility logic working
**Business Logic**: Community Manager methods and privacy rules functional
**UI Layer**: Template membership state and cross-user views operational
**Navigation**: Proper routing and context preservation maintained

### Privacy Visibility System ✅
- **My Communities**: Shows both role badges (Admin/Member) AND privacy badges (Public/Private)
- **All Communities**: Shows privacy badges for discovery
- **Single Community Pages**: Shows privacy badges in header
- **Events**: Privacy badges on listings and single pages
- **Conversations**: Privacy badges when conversations displayed
- **Color Standards**: Green=Public, Gray=Private, Blue=Admin, Green=Member

## Current Status: Core Community System Complete

### Community Integration Success ✅
All major community system issues have been resolved:
- ✅ **AJAX Join Working** - Real-time joining with proper error handling and database integration
- ✅ **Personal Communities** - All users have discoverable personal communities
- ✅ **Cross-User Visibility** - Public communities appear correctly in discovery
- ✅ **Member Management** - Functional members tab with role display
- ✅ **Privacy Visibility** - Comprehensive badge system across all content

### Current System State
- **9 Users**: Essential accounts only (removed 12 test accounts)
- **17 Communities**: Clean set with proper relationships for circle testing
- **Functional Discovery**: Two-tab system working (My Communities vs All Communities)
- **Real-time Joining**: AJAX workflow creating database records and updating UI
- **Privacy Awareness**: Users can see privacy status of all their content

## Next Phase: Advanced Platform Features

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Complete AI Assistant Integration** - Missing class-ai-assistant.php
2. **AT Protocol/Bluesky Integration** - Missing class-at-protocol-manager.php
3. **Advanced Conversation System** - Circle filtering optimization
4. **Event Management Enhancement** - Guest invitation workflow completion

### System Validation Tasks
1. **End-to-End User Journeys** - Test complete workflows from registration to participation
2. **Circle Filtering Verification** - Ensure content appears in correct trust circles
3. **Performance Optimization** - Database query optimization for larger datasets
4. **Security Audit** - Validate privacy controls and access permissions

### Production Readiness Goals
1. **Data Migration Scripts** - For moving from PartyMinder to VivalaTable
2. **Performance Benchmarking** - Load testing for community and event scaling
3. **Documentation Completion** - User guides and admin documentation
4. **Deployment Automation** - Production deployment and backup procedures

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Community System Architecture
- **Two-Layer Discovery** - Personal membership vs public discovery
- **Real-time Membership** - AJAX joining with immediate UI updates
- **Privacy-First Design** - Circles of Trust determine visibility
- **Context Preservation** - Community discussions stay in community context

### Integration Requirements
- Community joining must update both database and UI state
- Membership queries must be consistent across all templates
- Privacy rules must be enforced at database query level
- Cross-user visibility must respect community privacy settings

## Testing Strategy

### Community System Tests
```bash
# Test 1: Join community and verify membership
# Test 2: Check cross-user community visibility
# Test 3: Verify personal community discovery
# Test 4: Test conversation navigation context
# Test 5: Validate circle filtering integration
```

### Critical User Journeys
1. **New User Journey** - Register → discover communities → join → participate
2. **Community Creator Journey** - Create community → invite members → manage discussions
3. **Cross-User Discovery** - Browse public communities → join → access content
4. **Privacy Validation** - Create private community → verify access controls
